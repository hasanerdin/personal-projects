# Personal Projects

This repository contains a curated collection of personal and exploratory projects developed across different stages of my technical journey. The projects here focus on experimentation, learning, and hands-on implementation rather than production-ready systems.

They are intentionally grouped in a single repository to keep the main portfolio repositories focused on data science and applied AI projects.

## 🎮 Game Projects

Small-scale game implementations created to explore game logic, state management, and algorithmic thinking.

### 2048
An implementation of the popular 2048 puzzle game, focusing on grid-based state updates and rule-driven mechanics.

**Focus:** Algorithmic logic, state transitions, game rules

---

### Wordle Clone
A simple clone of the Wordle word game, built to experiment with word matching logic, feedback rules, and user interaction.

**Focus:** String processing, game logic, user interaction

---

### Conway’s Game of Life
A simulation of the classic cellular automaton, implemented to study rule-based systems, grid propagation, and iterative state updates.

**Focus:** Algorithmic simulation, state machines

---

## 🤖 Reinforcement Learning Experiments

Exploratory reinforcement learning projects aimed at understanding agent–environment interaction and learning dynamics. These projects prioritize conceptual understanding over full-scale ML pipelines.

### DQN
Deep Q-Network (DQN) experiments exploring value-based reinforcement learning and neural network–driven policies.

**Focus:** Q-learning, neural networks, RL fundamentals

---

### RL Learning
A collection of smaller reinforcement learning experiments and notes created during the learning process.

**Focus:** Core RL concepts, experimentation, learning-by-doing
