# 🟩 Wordle Clone in Unity

A fully functional Wordle clone built in Unity, following and expanding upon [this tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbcgqz5lM38&list=PLqlFiJjSZ2x39Qc0yj73Myixt8jmDUBNk&index=3).

## 📖 Overview
This project recreates the popular word puzzle "Wordle" while exploring Unity’s UI system, prefab workflows,  
and data-driven game design. The game challenges players to guess a hidden 5-letter word within 6 attempts,  
giving feedback for each guess.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Type a 5-letter word and press **Enter**.
2. Letters will be color-coded:
   - 🟩 **Green** – Correct letter in the correct position  
   - 🟨 **Yellow** – Correct letter in the wrong position  
   - ⬜ **Gray** – Letter not in the word
3. Guess the hidden word before you run out of attempts.

## 🔧 Tools & Systems Used
- **🎨 Canvas & UI Layouts** – Dynamic grid created using Grid Layout Groups
- **📦 Prefabs** – Letter tiles instantiated and updated at runtime
- **📄 Resources Folder** – Stores and loads the word list
- **⌨ Input Handling** – Captures keyboard input for letter entry and submission

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Creating responsive UI layouts with Unity’s Grid Layout Groups
- Prefab instantiation and runtime updates
- Loading and parsing data from the Resources folder
- Implementing word validation and feedback systems
- Managing game states and win/lose conditions
